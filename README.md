# hello-world


Hi there,
I am an engineering student doing my minor in mechanical engineering. 
On the side I am interested in working out, learning about value investing, 
spending time with friends and girlfriend, and recently getting in to coding.

First off I wil try to learn JavaScript syntax while discovering what this programming field is about. 
If all goes well I will try building my own website containing tools for my interests!



This is my first repository on GitHub. It is made following the introduction-tutorial.
